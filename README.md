3. **My  own definition of Big Data:** 
    * Big Data represents enourmous amount of data that generated with high velocity and often time are messy and noisy (unstructured) to deal with. 
    * Big Data can become powerful when we know which tool to orginize and convert them into meaningful information and knowledge. 
    * Becasue of its velocity, Big Data can convey more actionable knowledge in an immediate/ short time.
